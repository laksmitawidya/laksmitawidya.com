# Portfolio Project âœ¨

Finally, launch my v1 portofolio website ðŸ”¥ 
I am satisfied with clean and minimalist design with black and white colors


Crafted with NextJS, written in Visual Studio, styled with TailwindCSS, NextUI, and ShadCN UI, and sprinkled with design magic from Canva. Special thanks to ChatGPT for being my personal copy editor. Cheers to the team that made this possible! ðŸ˜Š
